1. creating extra trades
I want you to generate a script that converts the original trade to two separate trades in case where both the buy and 
sell side of a trade are non-USD currencies.

The two separate trades I define here:
The first trade is the sell trade.
The second trade is the buy trade.

For example, take the following example:

time	sell_asset_usd	sell_amount_usd	buy_asset_usd	buy_amount_usd	buy_usd_price	sell_usd_price	split	chck	
03/20/2023	EUR	3551.5151	PAXG	1.88567281	1.0718	2018.650247	TRUE	FALSE

In this case, EUR to PAXG are both non-USD currencies. You can check the "split" column for this. If this column is TRUE, 
you know that both have non-USD currencies. 
 
For this trade the following two separate trades should be created:

time	sell_asset_usd	sell_amount_usd	buy_asset_usd	buy_amount_usd	buy_usd_price	sell_usd_price	split	chck
03/20/2023	EUR	3551.5151	USD	$(buy_usd_price)*$(sell_amount_usd)	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL
03/20/2023	USD	$(buy_usd_price)*$(sell_amount_usd)	PAXG	$(buy_amount_usd)	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL

Where I am using variables in the row values to indicate which header column should be used.

For the first trade, the sell trade: 
	- the columns time, sell_asset_usd, sell_amount_usd you can copy from the original trade
	- the column buy_asset_usd will be "USD"
	- the buy_amount_usd column will get the value $(buy_usd_price)*$(sell_amount_usd) from the original trade

For the second trade, the buy trade:
	- the columns time and buy_asset_usd you can copy from the original trade
	- the column sell_asset_usd will be "USD"
	- the column sell_amount_usd will get the value $(buy_usd_price)*$(sell_amount_usd)
	- the column buy_amount_usd will get the value $(buy_amount_usd)

Please generate the python script



I want you to generate a script that will calculate my capital gains for my trades that I did in 2023. I have some trades in 2022 that influence the fiscal year 2023. 
So the data that you will receive will contains both data for 2022 and 2023.

I want you to use the FIFO method

I don't have a timestamp, only a date, but there is chronological order, so trades that come after another trade were done later.

I will give you the following format. I also give you some example trades:

id	time	source_currency	source_amount	buy_currency	buy_amount	profit	matched_with_id
1	03/20/2023	EUR	3551.5151	USD	3806.513884		
2	03/20/2023	USD	3806.513884	PAXG	1.88567281		
3	03/20/2023	EUR	1410.1474	USD	1511.395983		
4	03/20/2023	USD	1511.395983	PAXG	0.74848589		

If there is a profit for a certain trade (let's call it the "profit trade"), I want you to fill out the profit in the 
profit column. If there is a profit, I want you to fill out the matched_with_i column in the "profit trade" with the id of the trade with
which it was matched according to the FIFO rules. 

If there is a loss, don't fill out the profit column, but you do need to decrease the inventory. You also need to fill out the matched trade id.

The script will receive an input trades file named input_trades_for_taxes.tsv

Make sure that you set the correct date formatting settings because we had some errors before when handling dates.

Use the following initial inventory:
My balance at 1/1/2022	
EUR	500000
USD	500000

Please generate the script

Please confirm that you understood






This is my XMR purchase (it's in the input file):

id	time	source_currency	source_amount	buy_currency	buy_amount
1	03/17/2022	USD	40000	XMR	1333.333333

Here is when I sell it:

id	time	source_currency	source_amount	buy_currency	buy_amount
29	11/09/2023	XMR	15.00000001	USD	1920.766603

I definitely make a profit. Please revise the script if you see some errors
